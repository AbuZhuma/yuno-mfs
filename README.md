# Yuno - Real-Time Project Synchronization

Yuno is the first NPM package for real-time peer-to-peer project synchronization, enabling teams to code together like Google Docs but for entire projects.
Yuno lets you know what your team is building - as they build it.

## Features

- **Real-time P2P synchronization** of code, dependencies, and console output
- **No manual merges** - changes sync automatically between collaborators
- **End-to-end encryption** protects your code
- **Universal file support** - works with any file type across IDEs and editors
- **Zero configuration** setup

## Installation

```bash
npm install yuno-mfs
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a new Yuno room:
```bash
npx yuno create -r [room-name]
```

2. Initialize your configuration:
```bash
npx yuno init -r [room-name] -p [password] -u [username]
```

3. Start collaborating:
```bash
npx yuno start
```

## Core Technology

1. **P2P Network**: Developers connect directly without central servers
2. **Automatic Sync**: Code changes propagate in real-time
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins policy based on timestamps
4. **Encrypted Connections**: Your data stays private

## Use Cases

- Pair programming without VSCode Live Share
- Hackathons with distributed teams
- Real-time coding education
- Collaborative open-source development
- Any file-based collaboration
